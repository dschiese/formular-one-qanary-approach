### Context
In the 2022 summer semester the module *Softwareprojekt I* (Software project I) brought forth a project for digital form processing, following an interactive and chatbot driven approach. 

The result was a working chatbot which could lead users through some - pre-chosen - formulars. However, the approach didn't follow a linked-data approach. The extension of this projekt with linked-data technologies could solve some problems and provide some new features.
